      <p class="profilepara">I recently completed my Bachelor of Civil Engineering at RMIT. However, I realized that it wasn't the field I wanted to pursue a career in. I came across Software Development and was quickly drawn to its modernity, flexibility and ever-changing nature. Currently, I am working part-time as a support worker under the NDIS.</p>
      <p class="profilepara">I enjoy working out at the gym and lifting weights. It feels great and if you eat right, you can see the results too! However, I'm not a fan of cardio so I usually skip it. In addition to working out, I also dance Salsa. Starting dance was one of the best decisions I've made. It's super fun, gets your heart racing and you get to make lifelong friends along the way!</p>
