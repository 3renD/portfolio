      <p class="profilepara">I recently completed my Bachelor of Civil Engineering at RMIT. After completing my studies I realised I wasn't interested in the field enough to make a career out of it. This is when I came across Software Development. Due to its modernity, flexibility and its ever-changing nature I quickly became interested. As of right now, I am currently working part-time as a support worker under the NDIS.</p>
      <p class="profilepara">I love working-out at the gym. Lifting weights feels good and, if you eat right, you start to look good too! I don't like cardio though so I usually skip it. I also dance Salsa. Starting dance was one the best decision I've made. It's super fun, it gets your heart racing, and you get to make lifelong friends along the way!.</p>
